## DSCI_553 (Foundations and Applications of Data Mining)

#### Description
Data mining is a foundational piece of the data analytics skill set. At a high level, it allows the
analyst to discover patterns in data, and transform it into a usable product. The course will
taught data mining algorithms for analyzing very large data sets. It had an applied focus, in
that it was meant for preparing students to utilize topics in data mining to solve real world
problems
